# APEX Live Validation

Client-side form validation in Oracle APEX

## About

The APEX Live Validation plugin lets you create client-side form validations without having to write a single line of JavaScript code.
The APEX plugin is built on top of a self made jQuery plugin that was created specifically for client-side validation handling in APEX.
