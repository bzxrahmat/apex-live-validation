APEX Live Validation
====================

Client-side form validation in Oracle APEX

##About

The APEX Live Validation plugin lets you create client-side form validations in just a few mouse clicks
without having to write a single line of JavaScript code.
The APEX plugin is built on top of a self made jQuery plugin that was created specifically for
client-side validation handling in APEX. The minimum required version for the APEX plugin is 4.1.
Older versions, however, can use the jQuery plugin instead.
There is no difference between the end result of both plugin types,
the jQuery plugin is just a bit less developer friendly.
